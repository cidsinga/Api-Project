# Dog and Cat API

#### _By Casey Idsinga_

## Description

This API contains info for an animal shelter and will list the Dogs and Cats at the shelter

##### API info

This API contains info on:

* Name of dog or cat

* Age

* Color

* Whether or not the animal is kid friendly

## Current Functionality

This API is set up to have two distinct functions, searching for info on a Cat, or info on a Dog.  Endpoints will be directed at the type of animal, before listing the specific animals attributes.  This will include GET requests for Cats and Get requests for Dogs, as well as POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE for both.

#### Navigation

* /dogs will show all Dogs
* /cats will show all Cats
* /dogs/1 will show the dog with the ID of 1
* /cats/1 will show the cat with the ID of 1

### Features in Development

Currently working on implementing search by the most recently available animal, animals age, color, and whether they are kid friendly or not.
